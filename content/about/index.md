My name is Kochergin Vladimir.

I'm from *Moscow, Russia*.

I have 5+ years of experience in web development using PHP, MySQL, Laravel, and other frameworks.

Two years ago, I switched to Go, and I loved it!

My latest commercial Go projects include Telegram chat-bots, APIs, and microservices within high-load systems. I've also developed a couple of open-source packages, which you can see in my Github profile.

I would love to work at startups and create new and ambitious projects.
